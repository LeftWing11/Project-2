Our Project Layout:

- We want to Create a trading bot for cryptocurrency with different strategies. Each strategy will correspond to a different machine-learning algorithm. We will then compare the performance of these models to our creation of an inefficient frontier of different portfolios of cryptos we are using.   
- Models we will use:

1. SVM
2. LogisticRegression 
3. RandomForestRegressor(New Machine Learning Model)


- We will use the following cryptocurrency:


“”
1. Eth
2. BTC
3. BNB
4. XRP

“”

- DataSources

1. Binance API for historical and live crypto data 
2. We will also use Yahoo Finance to collate data if required, 

Modules

—- Undecided Module for a new machine learning algorithm
